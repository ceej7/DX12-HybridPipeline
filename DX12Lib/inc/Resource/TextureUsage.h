 *
 *  @brief The TextureUsage enumeration describes how a texture is used.
 *  Albedo (diffuse) textures should be loaded and stored using sRGB formats
 *  so that the texture sampler will automatically linearize the color when 
 *  sampled.
 *  Height maps and normals must must not be linearized during load and thus 
 *  must ignore any sRGB settings that they may contain in the metadata of the 
 *  image file.
